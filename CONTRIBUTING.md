## Submitting changes

To submit pull requests, please visit [this page](https://github.com/fleeksoft/ksoup/pulls).
Keep in mind that maintainers will have to support the code resulting from your contribution. Therefore, please
familiarize yourself with the following guidelines:

* All development (both new features and bug fixes) should be performed in the `develop` branch.
    * The `release-*` branch hosts the sources of the most recently released version.
    * Base your pull requests against the `release` branch.
    * Ensure to [Build the project](#building) to verify that everything works and passes the tests.
* If you are fixing a bug:
    * Write the test that reproduces the bug.
    * Fixes without tests are accepted only under exceptional circumstances, such as when writing a corresponding test
      is too hard or impractical.
    * Follow the project's style for writing tests: name test functions as testXxx. Avoid using backticks in test names.
* If you wish to work on an existing issue, comment on it first. Ensure that the issue clearly describes a problem and a
  solution that has received positive feedback. Propose a solution if none is suggested.
